# My Vibe Coding Experience

## 1. Tool Selection Justification
I chose **Bolt.new** for this project because it provides an immediate full-stack environment in the browser. It allowed me to focus on the design and functionality of the Weather Dashboard without spending time on local setup.

## 2. Development Process
The development was entirely conversation-driven. It took approximately 4 prompts to get the dashboard working. The most effective command was: "Make the UI look modern with a glassmorphism effect and use Lucide-react icons for the weather states."

## 3. Challenges and Solutions
The biggest challenge was connecting to the live API. I had to manually guide the AI to use environment variables to protect my API key, which is a standard security best practice.

## 4. Reflection
Vibe coding has fundamentally changed my workflow by allowing me to spend more time as a "reviewer" rather than just a "typist." It is incredibly powerful for prototyping, though I would still prefer a manual code review for production-level apps.
