## Part 2: Analysis of the "Vibe Coding" Shift

### Traditional Code Completion vs. Vibe Coding
Traditional completion tools like IntelliSense only provide suggestions for the current line of code. Vibe coding tools go beyond this by using project-wide context to predict entire features rather than just words.

### GitHub Copilot vs. Vibe Coding
While GitHub Copilot acts as a passive assistant that waits for user input, vibe tools are agentic. They can independently plan a workflow, run terminal commands to install packages, and fix their own bugs based on terminal errors.

### Integrated IDE vs. Web Chat
Integrated vibe coding eliminates the "copy-paste tax" associated with separate windows like ChatGPT. By having a direct view of the terminal and file system, the AI reduces hallucinations and speeds up the development lifecycle.
